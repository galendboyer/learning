8. Core Components
Web Server
Scheduler
Meta Database
Triggerer       -> Manages tasks dependent on external events
Executor        -> Determines how tasks will be run
Queue           ->
Worker          -> Processes that perform the tasks.


9. Core Concepts

DAG                -> Directed Acycli Graph

Operator           -> Single, ideally idempotent. task in DAG
                      Allow to break down workflow into discrete managable pieces of work
                      ie (Break 5 eggs)
                      
                      List of Operators: https://registry.astronomer.io/providers

Task/Task Instance -> Task is a specific instance of an operator.
                      When operator is assigned to a DAG, it becomes a task.
                      ie: (Break 5 eggs on July 1st at 2pm)
                      
Workflow           -> Entire process defined by DAG, including all tasks and their dependencies.
                      DAG is basically a Workflow.

10. Airflow is NOT!
Data processing framework
Realtime streaming solution
Data storage system

NOT GOOD AT:
High-frequency, sub-minute scheduling.
Processing large datasets directly, orchestrate them but not perform them.
Real-Time data streaming.
Simple, linear workflows with few dependencies, might be overkill.

11. Architectures

Single-Node: All components of Airflow are running on a single computer or server.

Multi-Node:  Can add more workers
             Reliability
             Process more tasks simultaneously

14. What is Docker
Universal packaging system for software.
