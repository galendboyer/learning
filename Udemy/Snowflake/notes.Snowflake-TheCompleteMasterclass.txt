?Why do queries get queued?

?Why can't database vendors focus on views defined with COPY OPTIONS?

?I didn't quite understand the '@' usage in prefixing object names?

?GIT_REPOSITORIES within Snowflake?

?Schemas can have type of table for CREATE TABLE PERMANENT/TRANSIENT/TEMPORARY?

?What happens to later storage when time traveling?
